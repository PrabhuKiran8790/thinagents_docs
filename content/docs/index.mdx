## Quick Example

Create an agent and add a custom tool in just a few lines:

```py title="example.py"
import os
from thinagents import Agent

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"

def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

agent = Agent(
    name="Math Agent",
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    tools=[add],
)

response = agent.run("What is 2 + 3? Use the add tool.")
print(response.content)
```
